Reading Progress Calculator: [Download latest release](https://github.com/Alsweider/ReadCalc/releases/latest)

This programme helps calculate reading progress for books without correct page numbering and e-books.
Even if your e-reader only has a percentage display, it can be used to calculate the approximate 
page of the printed book.
